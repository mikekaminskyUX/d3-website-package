                <h5>Organizational Context:</h5>
                <p>
                What are the roots of human behavior?  How do we make decisions, and what forces shape those decisions?  How can we apply what we learn about human health and behavior to inform and improve public policy to make it more effective?  Thanks to new technologies and advances in fields like genetics, neuroscience, and urban informatics, we can break down the silos between these and other fields to unlock novel insights into human behavior and enable the development of scientifically driven public policy.  Data Cubed Inc (D3) will entail gathering information at an unprecedented level of breadth and detail, ranging from health and medical data to financial tracking and social networks for a representative sample of 10,000 New York City residents. D3 will study New York City residents for 10-20 years, and will do for the field of behavioral science what other major projects did for their respective fields, like the Human Genome Project or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</p>
